<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">General information</a><a class="headerlink" href="#general-information" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the Linux driver architecture to virtualize SOF DSP
firmware features across multiple guest VMs.</p>
<p>The following components are described:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>SOF VirtIO (Virtual Frontend) driver to be run on a guest virtual machine.</p></li>
<li><p>SOF vhost (Virtual Backend) driver to be run on the host.</p></li>
<li><p>SOF audio topology for both host and guest.</p></li>
<li><p>SOF supporting code in QEMU.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This driver architecture allows full SOF audio use cases to reside on either
the guest VM, or host, or both. It also allows non audio DSP firmware
features to be virtualized on guests.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=virtio">VirtIO</a> is a platform-agnostic virtualization standard, managed by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>. It
defines a design and a protocol for implementing device IO in VMs.</p>
<p>Different machine-level virtualization designs exist, and each implements a
different software configurations. Typically each design has one instance of
a general purpose OS that runs either directly on the hardware, or at least
with direct unrestricted access to the hardware. This instance is usually
called a âhost.â Within that host OS, one or more user-space processes exist
that further emulate independent virtual machines and run their own complete
instances of general-purpose OSes. Those instances are called âguests.â</p>
<p>When Linux is running in a VM, multiple drivers are already available, using
virtio: networking, storage, etc. Those drivers use the virtio and virtqueue
APIs to communicate with the host or, potentially, with other guests.</p>
<p>The host part depends on the used virtualization solution. Some
solutions implement the VirtIO API themselves while using their method of
choice to talk to the host on which they are running. A typical Linux
virtualization implementation uses QEMU + KVM to run guest instances. In
this case, a VirtIO host can be implemented in the user space or in the
kernel. If implemented in the user space, it is managed by QEMU. In thekernel space, VirtIO host drivers use the Linux vhost API.</p>
<p>Note that VirtIO guest drivers reside in their respective driver
subdirectories in the Linux kernel, such as drivers/net, drivers/block, etc.
On the contrary, all vhost drivers are located under drivers/vhost. That
directory also contains vhost.c and vhost.h which are used by all vhost
drivers.</p>
<p>Every VirtIO driver requires explicit support in QEMU, which can be very
minimal and simple in cases where all the functionality is implemented in
VirtIO and vhost drivers, or it can actually implement a user-space
counterpart to VirtIO drivers on the guest. In our case, the SOF QEMU
support code is rather minimal; it only adds support for guest reset
reporting and guest identification to a set standard and mostly empty device
node and virtual queue management operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">SOF VirtIO design</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://sofproject.org/">SOF</a> VirtIO design implements an interface to transport IPC (
Inter-Process Communication) commands and audio data between host and
guests. It re-uses the SOF-defined IPC API (that is also used by the native
SOF driver) to communicate with the SOF firmware that is running on the
audio DSP. This means that the virtualization mechanisms are inserted
between the SOF host driver and the DSP hardware. Thus, IPC messages that
the guest SOF driver sends to the DSP are instead sent to the host, which
then forwards them to the DSP firmware, and then returns the response.</p>
<p>Typically an IPC message exchange between the driver and the DSP takes place
over a mailbox and a doorbell. A mailbox is a shared memory region between
the DSP and host. It is used for the IPC message payload. A doorbell is
asynchronous signaling hardware between DSP and host. This mailbox /
doorbell interface can be hardware-specific; thus, every hardware variant
provides its own set of mailbox / doorbell handling operations. This
virtualization solution creates its own set of IPC operations to redirect
IPC messages from the guest over virtual queues to the host.</p>
<p>We use the same IPC message structures; we also add three more
VirtIO-specific IPC messages but they are never sent to the DSP, so the
firmware doesnât need to support them. For the most part, IPCs from guests
are forwarded without change by the host driver to the DSP; only some of
them are intercepted on the host. Some IPC messages trigger additional
actions on the host before being forwarded to the DSP; others arenât sent to
the DSP at all. See examples below for more details.</p>
<div class="section" id="communication-channels">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Communication channels</a><a class="headerlink" href="#communication-channels" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The goals of SOF virtualization are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Enable streaming to/from guest audio endpoints with the lowest possible
overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow a guest to control some of the processing on the DSP while
isolating it from other parts of the graph owned by the host or other VMs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This includes avoiding copying of audio data and stream position updates. In
this case, only one VirtQueue would be required for IPC message exchange.
However, the initial version also transfers data and stream position updates
via VirtQueues. That means that the SOF VirtIO / vhost drivers currently use
three VirtQueues: for IPC, audio data, and stream position updates. Plans to
support both the copying and the zero-copy methods are forthcoming. The
copying method will be used either where the zero-copy method is unavailable
or for debugging.</p>
<p>The low latency requirement also forces us to only support the vhost mode;
no plans exist to implement SOF VirtIO host support in the user space.</p>
<p>Below is the SOF VirtIO architecture:</p>

<div class="section" id="topology">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Topology</a><a class="headerlink" href="#topology" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When running natively, the SOF driver uses the ALSA topology API to configure
audio pipelines on the DSP. The SOF driver reads a platform-specific topology
file from the filesystem, parses it, and sends all the components from it to the DSP firmware for their instantiation, configuration, and enablement.</p>
<p>When configured to support virtualized audio, the host topology additionally
provides connection points for guest audio pipelines. Guest playback
pipelines might, for example, connect to mixer and capture pipelines to
demultiplexer components. In this way, both the host and possibly multiple
guests can share parts of the audio topology. It is also possible to
dedicate certain audio pipelines to specific guests only. In such cases,
guest pipeline fragments can be connected to other component types such as
volume control. The term âconnection pointsâ is used throughout this
document to refer to these locations in the host audio topology. In the
<a class="reference internal" href="#example-topology-image">example topology image</a> below, the sink endpoint of the âMaster volumeâ
component is a connection point.</p>
<p>The ALSA / ASoC / DAPM subsystems on the host are unaware of any guests, but
they should be aware of any streaming taking place on host parts of VM
pipelines for configuration and power management. That means that if, for
example, a guest initializes playback, the ASoC subsystem on the host should
be aware that the pipeline joining the respective connection point and the
used codec is currently performing audio playback. To achieve this, for each
such guest connection point we add a virtual PCM as a widget of type
âaif_inâ or âaif_outâ for playback and capture respectively, and a virtual
0-size buffer. The 0-size buffer is required by ALSA which mandates that one
side of each topology connection must always be a buffer. These virtual
components are only visible on the host and are not sent to the DSP. When
processed by the ASoC topology parser, those virtual PCM widgets serve as
DPCM front-ends and thus create front-end DAI links and ASoC PCM runtime
contexts. These are later used for guest audio stream management.</p>
<p>When running in a VM, the SOF driver also uses ALSA topology; in this case,
the guest topology should have no relation to the host hardware. The guest
audio topology should be decided upon by the host system administrator.
Therefore we let the SOF instance, running on the guest, obtain topology
from the host. Such a topology should only contain âsoftware componentsâ
like PCMs, buffers, and software volume controls. Those components thus
represent partial pipelines that will then be linked to connection points of
the host SOF topology.</p>
<p>Given this design, the topology is represented in the following way:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/topology-v2.png" id="example-topology-image" src="../../_images/topology-v2.png" />
<p><strong>DSP:</strong> Has a full topology, including host and guests components. No
distinction is made between the host and any guests.</p>
<p><strong>host:</strong> The SOF driver core, running on the host, and the ASoC subsystem
only see the host topology. The vhost driver manages connection points
between the host and the guestsâ topology fragments.</p>
<p><strong>guest:</strong> Only âseesâ the guest components; therefore, the driver cannot
address components that do not belong to its topology.</p>
<p>Refer to the SOF virtualized IPC paths below:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/ipc-v3.png" src="../../_images/ipc-v3.png" />
<p>As mentioned above, SOF IPC messages from guests are forwarded exactly
1-to-1 to the DSP. For example, if a guest sends an IPC message to adjust
the audio volume on one of the components from its topology, it will be
forwarded to the DSP. That IPC contains the volume component ID as seen by
the respective guest. Therefore, it should be exactly the same ID as the one
used by the firmware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dpcm-audio-routing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">DPCM audio routing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#dpcm-audio-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>In the most trivial case when a user-space application opens an audio
interface, there is a unique sequence of audio components, involved in this
operation, that will comprise a DPCM audio route. Such a sequence is called
an audio pipeline. However, modern audio hardware often contains more
complex audio graphs, sometimes requiring dynamic re-routing. Support for
such configurations is provided by the ASoC <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.16/sound/soc/dpcm.html">DPCM</a> API. We also use this API
to activate and deactivate guest audio interfaces.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Initialization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The SOF driver probing on the host remains unmodified except that the vhost
driver is also initialized; this registers a newly-added /dev/vhost-dsp misc
device that is used by guests to establish VirtQueue links and control the
SOF vhost driver, using dedicated vhost ioctls.</p>
<p>When QEMU starts a guest instance, it detects the above misc device and
creates a PCI device for the guest with dedicated vendor and device IDs. All
vhost PCI devices use the Qumranet / RedHat vendor ID and are allocated a
device ID from a range, specially donated by RedHat for this purpose.</p>
<p>The SOF VirtIO driver on the guest registers support for that PCI device and
its .probe() method is called.</p>
<p>During the SOF VirtIO driver probing, the QEMU SOF code reports to the vhost
driver which VM image is being instantiated. This is used as a reliable
guest identification and is needed for SOF guest audio topology selection.</p>
<p>The SOF driver on the guest performs partial initialization; it skips any
steps involving communicating with the actual DSP such as sending the
firmware, booting it, and initializing the tracing interface.</p>
<p>The VirtIO driver on the guest uses a new SOF_IPC_TPLG_VFE_GET
VirtIO-specific IPC message to request the topology from the host. The host
reads the file that corresponds to the guest ID (obtained from the QEMU
communication described above) from its filesystem, and then sends it in
multiple chunks to the guest in reply to that request.</p>
<p>Guest topology files contain virtual DAI components of type âdai_outâ and
âdai_in.â Their data tuples contain a new token of type SOF_TKN_COMP_REF,
which contains an ID of the connection point, to which this pipeline should
be attached.</p>
<p>After obtaining the topology, the guest SOF instance uses a second new
SOF_IPC_TPLG_VFE_COMP_ID VirtIO-specific IPC message to request its allocated
component ID base. It then uses this base to assign IDs to all of its
topology components. Those components are then sent to the DSP firmware.
This ensures that no two components that are sent to the DSP have the same
ID. Note that gaps in component IDs are allowed and donât have any side
effects.</p>
<p>The host maintains a list of guest component ID ranges to guarantee that
component IDs stay unique regardless of the order in which guests are
brought up and down.</p>
<p>Next, the guest proceeds by sending the parsed topology over IPC to the host,
which is then forwarded to the DSP firmware. The guest uses the .send_msg()
callback to forward any IPC (including topology related) to the host with no
processing at all. The only exception is blocking IPCs when the guest is
resuming while the host does not need to be resumed (see <a class="reference internal" href="#reset-count">reset count</a> in
Deactivation for details).</p>
<p>The host receives the parsed guest topology over the IPC virtual queue. In
most cases, the host IPC handler just forwards IPCs to the DSP; in other
cases, it has to handle or modify IPC contents locally. One such example is
linking the guest and host topology fragments together. As mentioned above,
guest topology files contain a new token that references connection point
components in the host topology. This value is then assigned to the
.ref_comp_id field of struct sof_ipc_comp_config during topology file
parsing and is sent by the guest to the host. The host then uses that value
to modify SOF_IPC_TPLG_COMP_CONNECT connection IPC messages, involving
connection points, from the guest before sending them to the DSP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="streaming">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Streaming</a><a class="headerlink" href="#streaming" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Guest audio streaming is mostly transparent for the host. The host audio
subsystem doesnât get involved with most guest streaming or kcontrol
operations because the virtualization is applied at the SOF hardware driver
level, not at the ASoC API level. Those operations are completely processed
on the guest and only resulting DSP IPCs are forwarded to the host. The only
exceptions are beginning and ending of the streaming, at which times the
ASoC subsystem on the host has to be informed that a certain pipeline is
becoming active or inactive respectively.</p>
<p>The SOF vhost driver uses the STREAM_PCM_PARAMS IPC message from the guest to
allocate an ALSA PCM runtime object and configure the audio hardware. If
zero-copy is not used and audio data is transferred via VirtQueues, DMA
buffers are also allocated.</p>
<p>Upon reception of the STREAM_TRIG_START IPC message, the vhost driver
activates the associated pipeline and updates the DPCM routing information
on the host.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is our goal to implement data zero-copy. As long as
this isnât the case, the guest VirtIO driver implements .block_write() and
.block_read() SOF DSP operation methods for data streaming via the data
VirtQueue.</p>
<p>The host receives requests on the data VirtQueue and copies data between PCM
runtime buffers and the queue and responds either with a status or with a
data buffer.</p>
<p>Similar to the data, streaming buffer position updates are currently also
transferred via a dedicated VirtQueue. Both the host and the guest are
configured to use IPC messages for position updates. Buffers for VirtIO
VirtQueues are always provided by guests; therefore a position update buffer
should always be waiting on the host side to send a position update message
as soon as one arrives from the DSP.</p>
<p>Upon reception of the STREAM_TRIG_STOP IPC message, the vhost driver updates
the DPCM routing information and deactivates the virtual PCM pipeline,
described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#topology">Topology</a> section above, on the host. This operation
requires particular care; in the present state, simply calling</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>soc_dpcm_runtime_update();
snd_soc_runtime_deactivate();
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>does not deactivate the pipeline and therefore doesnât allow the runtime PM
to suspend the interface, which then breaks following activation attempts.
The current SOF VirtIO implementation contains a fix for that, which has to
be upstreamed along with the rest of the ALSA core virtualization
modifications and extensions.</p>

<div class="section" id="deactivation">

<p>When the guest isnât actively using audio, we want to allow the host to
runtime suspend the DSP. That usually means switching off the DSP. Therefore,
resuming after a runtime suspend is similar to booting the DSP for the first
time during driver probing. During host driver probing, the driver reads in a
DSP firmware image and a topology file and sends both to the DSP. The driver
then keeps the firmware and the topology in RAM to be re-sent to the DSP for
runtime resume. The guest driver in the virtualized setup does the same: it
keeps its topology fragment in memory and only re-sends it to the host for
DSP resume.</p>
<p>With automatic runtime suspending on the host and the guest, we must
guarantee that the host never suspends the hardware while any of the
guests are active. Therefore, it is natural to forward guestsâ power
transition events to the host. We add a SOF_IPC_PM_VFE_POWER_STATUS IPC
message for this purpose. Only when all guests have entered runtime-suspend
and any local users have released their audio resources can the host
runtime-suspend the DSP.</p>
<p id="reset-count">Special consideration is given to the case when a guest resumes after a
runtime suspend. If the DSP also was suspended since the last time that
guest was using it, it has lost the respective topology fragment. However,
if the DSP stayed powered on, it still has the guestâs topology and it
shouldnât be received again. To achieve this, the host replies to the
SOF_IPC_PM_VFE_POWER_STATUS message with a status flag, indicating whether
the topology has to be re-sent.</p>
<p>Guest reboot also requires special handling to deinitialize virtual queues.
At the moment, no standard way exists to get notified about the guest reboot
event on the host. Various vhost drivers implement this in their own
context-specific ways. For example, the vhost networking driver uses a link
status update for that purpose. However, the vsock vhost driver comes very
close to our needs. It doesnât have a suitable context notification;
therefore, it implements a dedicated QEMU / misc-device ioctl
VHOST_VSOCK_SET_RUNNING. We reuse the ioctl definition, but change its name
to VHOST_SET_RUNNING. In this way, no existing user-space software has to be
modified. Then, we use this ioctl() in the QEMU SOF code to inform the SOF
vhost driver about a guest reboot. This is then used to reset the VirtQueue
status on the host.</p>
